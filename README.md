# LingQ To Anki
A script that pulls up all LingQs from your LingQ account and adds them to Anki
as flashcards.

# Usage

Make sure Anki is running in the background and the AnkiConnect plugin is added
(you can find it [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)).


```
pip install poetry
poetry run ./main.py -h
```

# History

Losely based on [squivix's package](https://github.com/squivix/LingQ-to-Anki), but I think I 
ended up rewriting basically every line of code.
